  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Hello I am Reilly! a passionate freelance graphic designer who loves art and got into graphic design in Junior High year, with 2 years of professional college experience in; Indesign, Illustrator, HTML/CSS, and Photoshop. I enjoy making creations of my own, as well as for others, as my passion for art and design is a key part of my life. I work very well with others but prefer to have my own space to focus and work.</p>
  
  <h2>Why I Do It</h2>
     
  <p>Since i was young i have had a passion for art, it is one of the biggest hobbies i have that is both very enjoyable and a great stress relief for the days i just need to disconnect from the real world. I love diving into the world of fantasy and imagination so i base all my design's off those, I enjoy designing stories around them. I will share some of my neat little creatures with small descriptions on what they are and how i created them.</p>
