    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hello I am Reilly! A passionate freelance graphic designer who loves art
      and got into graphic design in Junior High year, with 2 years of
      professional college experience in; Indesign, Illustrator, HTML/CSS, and
      Photoshop. I enjoy making creations of my own, as well as for others, as
      my passion for art and design is a key part of my life. I work very well
      with others but prefer to have my own space to focus and work.
    </p>

    <h2>Why I Do It</h2>

    <p>
      Since i was young i have had a passion for art, it is one of the biggest
      hobbies i have that is both very enjoyable and a great stress relief for
      the days i just need to disconnect from the real world. I love diving into
      the world of fantasy and imagination so i base all my design's off those,
      I enjoy designing stories around them. I will share some of my neat little
      creatures with small descriptions on what they are and how i created them.
    </p>

          "I had a dream once about a fairy that could transform into a dragon
          it’s color’s represent the earth and sky where the fairy lived, so I
          decided to take that dream and turn it into a character design for a
          story. I enjoy taking my dreams and turning them into character
          designs and or stories, as dreams make for the best design concept’s."

          "Took two of my favourite things! Magic and cats. The colors have no
          real purpose they just looked nice to me it pulled the design together
          nicely to make this lil furry friend for my stories."

        <p>
          "I have yet to see a lot of zombie/undead themed character design
          being used nowadays so I decided to take that theme and cross it with
          a bunny! The blue flames I found complement the design perfectly. This
          design is one of my favourite’s."
