  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Hello I am Reilly! a passionate freelance graphic designer who loves art and got into graphic design in Junior High year, with 2 years of professional college experience in; Indesign, Illustrator, HTML/CSS, and Photoshop. I enjoy making creations of my own, as well as for others, as my passion for art and design is a key part of my life. I work very well with others but prefer to have my own space to focus and work.</p>
  
  <h2>Why I Do It</h2>
     
  <p>Since i was young i have had a passion for art, it is one of the biggest hobbies i have that is both very enjoyable and a great stress relief for the days i just need to disconnect from the real world. I love diving into the world of fantasy and imagination so i base all my design's off those, I enjoy designing stories around them. I will share some of my neat little creatures with small descriptions on what they are and how i created them.</p>

      <h3>Fairy Dragon;</h3>
      <div class="faedragon">
        <img class="dragon" src="images/faedragon.png" alt="TEXT">
        </div>
      <p>I had a dream once about a fairy that could transform into a dragon it’s color’s represent the earth and sky where the fairy lived, so I decided to take that dream and turn it into a character design for a story. I enjoy taking my dreams and turning them into character designs and or stories, as dreams make for the best design concept’s.</p>

  <h3>Mythical Cat;</h3>
  <div class="catdesign"></div>
  <img class="magiccat" src="images/catdesign.png" alt="TEXT">
  </div>
  <p>Took two of my favourite things! Magic and cats. The colors have no real purpose they just looked nice to me it pulled the design together nicely to make this lil furry friend for my stories.</p>

  <h3>Zombie Rabbit;</h3>
  <div class="rabbitdesign">
    <img class="zombierabbit" src="images/rabbitdesign.png" alt="TEXT">
    </div>  
  <p>I have yet to see a lot of zombie/undead themed character design being used nowadays so I decided to take that theme and cross it with a bunny! The blue flames I found complement the design perfectly. This design is one of my favourite’s.</p>

  <h3>Dream Caterpillar;</h3>
  <div class="creaturedesign">
    <img class="creaturedesign" src="images/creaturedesign.png" alt="TEXT">
    </div>
  <p>This little guy came from another dream like the fairy dragon but instead of seeing any creatures it was more like a flash of colors that ended up giving me an idea so I crossed a caterpillar and a soft midnight theme.</p>
