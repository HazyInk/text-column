  <h2>Why I Do It</h2>
     
  <p>Since i was young i have had a passion for art, it is one of the biggest hobbies i have that is both very enjoyable and a great stress relief for the days i just need to disconnect from the real world. I love diving into the world of fantasy and imagination so i base all my design's off those, I enjoy designing stories around them. I will share some of my neat little creatures with small descriptions on what they are and how i created them.</p>
